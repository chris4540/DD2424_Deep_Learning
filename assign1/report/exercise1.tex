In this exercise, a python version of multi-linear classifier was implemented.
The function to compute the gradient with analytical method was competed.

Unit tests for the function computing the gradient were written. In those unit tests,
I used \texttt{numpy.testing.assert\_allclose} to check if all the elements of two pairs of gradients,
\texttt{gradW} and \texttt{gradb}, computed from the analytical method and the numerical methods are closed.
In the assertion, the following equation is element-wise true, otherwise the unit test will fail.

\begin{equation*}
    % absolute(a - b) <= (atol + rtol * absolute(b))
    |a - b| \leq (\texttt{atol} + \texttt{rtol} * |b|)
\end{equation*}
where \texttt{atol} and \texttt{rtol} are the tolerance parameters.

Since the forward difference method is less accurate than the central difference method,
the tolerance parameters are different when comparing them to analytical method.
I set \texttt{atol} as \num{1e-7} and \texttt{rtol} as \num{1e-06} for the
forward difference method and set \texttt{atol} as \num{1e-9} and \texttt{rtol} as \num{1e-07}
for the central difference method.
